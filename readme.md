Getting and saving form data from one remote server to the another can be tough. littleForm solves the client-side serialization problem with Node.js by accepting a normal POST request from an HTML form element. From there, it's efficient to work with the request object and insert data into Mongo collections. The only node dependcy so far is mongodb so I included the JSON package.  

npm install

npm install mongodb --mongodb:native
